## 🚀 Starting the Server

### Method 1: Using Batch File (Recommended)
```cmd
c:\xampp\htdocs\edumanage\api\start-server.bat
```

### Method 2: Using NPM
```cmd
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\edumanage\api
npm start
```

### Method 3: Using Node Directly
```cmd
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\edumanage\api
node server.js
```

The server will start on **http://localhost:3000**

---

## 📝 Testing the API

### Browser Testing
Simply open your browser and navigate to:
- Health check: http://localhost:3000/api/health
- Students list: http://localhost:3000/api/students (requires auth)
- Any other endpoint listed above

### Using the Quick Test Script
```cmd
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\edumanage\api
node quick-test.js
```

### Manual API Testing
1. **Login to get token:**
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

2. **Use the returned token in subsequent requests:**
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/students
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
```
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=edumanage
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
```

### Database Connection
- Host: localhost
- Port: 3306 (MySQL via XAMPP)
- Database: edumanage
- User: root
- Password: (empty)

## 🔧 Important Notes

### Known Issues
1. **PowerShell HTTP Requests**: PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest` may be blocked by Windows Firewall/Defender. Use browser or Node-based tests instead.
2. **XAMPP Must Be Running**: Ensure MySQL service is started in XAMPP Control Panel before starting the API server.
3. **Working Directory**: The server must be started from the `api` directory or using the provided batch file.

### Database Schema Notes
- Primary keys use VARCHAR (not auto-increment integers)
- Student IDs: STU001, STU002, etc.
- Subject IDs: SUBJ001, SUBJ002, etc.
- JSON fields for relationships (denormalized design)
- Snake_case column naming (student_id, full_name, created_at)

## ✅ Next Steps

The API is fully functional and ready for frontend integration. You can now:

1. **Test all endpoints** using the browser or Postman
2. **Integrate with frontend** - Update HTML/JS files to call the API
3. **Add more features** - Implement additional endpoints as needed
4. **Deploy** - Move to production when ready

### Recommended Frontend Integration Steps:
1. Update `shared/auth-manager.js` to use `http://localhost:3000/api/auth`
2. Update `shared/result-manager.js` to fetch from `/api/results`
3. Update `shared/payment-manager.js` to fetch from `/api/payments`
4. Test login flows from `admin-login.html`, `student-login.html`, etc.
